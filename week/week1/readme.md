the following is a ChatGPT generated project idea that have prompted to help with better understanding data structures in java.
the idea is to make it as intermediate as possible and not entirely depend on the use of spring\spring-boot
while still helping me get a solid understanding of how different structures can be used in a real-world application
and still allowing me to work primarily in java .

# Project: Library Management System

## Project Overview:
Create a library management system to manage books, authors, and categories. 
This project will help you utilize various data structures to handle book management efficiently. 
It will be implemented purely in Java, and you can choose to add a database if desired for persistence.

## Key Features:

### Book Management:
* ***Add***: Add new books with attributes like title, author, category, and publication date.
* ***Update***: Update book details.
* ***Delete***: Remove books from the system.
* ***Search***: Search for books by title, author, or category.

### Author Management:
* ***Add***: Add new authors.
* ***Update***: Update author details.
* ***Delete***: Remove authors.

### Category Management:
* ***Add***: Define and manage categories.
* ***Update***: Update category details.
* ***Delete***: Remove categories.

### Data Structures:
* ***Books***: Use HashMap or TreeMap for efficient book lookups and management.
* ***Authors***: Use HashSet or TreeSet to manage unique authors.
* ***Categories***: Use HashMap to categorize books efficiently.

### Optional Database:
Implement a simple database (e.g., SQLite or H2) to store book, author, and category data.
This will help you understand how data structures are used in a real-world application for persistence.

### API and Documentation:
* ***API***: Expose a simple REST API to manage books, authors, and categories.
* ***Swagger***: Use Swagger to document your API endpoints and provide a user interface for interacting with the API.

## Technologies to Use:
* ***Java***: For implementing the core logic and data structures.
* ***Swagger***: For API documentation and testing.
* ***Optional Database***: SQLite or H2 for persistence (if desired).

## Project Breakdown:
### Define Data Models:
Create classes for Book, Author, and Category.

### Implement Data Structures:
* Use HashMap or TreeMap to manage books with unique identifiers.
* Use HashSet or TreeSet to manage authors and categories.

### Implement CRUD Operations:
Implement methods to create, read, update, and delete books, authors, and categories.

### Optional Database Integration:
* Set up an in-memory database (e.g., SQLite or H2) if you want to learn about persistence.
* Use JDBC or an ORM like Hibernate to interact with the database.

### Create API Endpoints:
Implement a simple REST API using a lightweight framework like JAX-RS or Spring Boot (if needed).
Expose endpoints for managing books, authors, and categories.

### Set Up Swagger:
Integrate Swagger to document your API endpoints and provide an interactive interface for testing.

### Testing:
Write unit tests to ensure the correctness of your data structures and CRUD operations.

### Documentation:
Provide clear documentation for your API using Swagger.
